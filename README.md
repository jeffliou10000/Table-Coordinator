"# Table-Coordinator" 
Hi, this is a small tool for anyone who lacks of one more accelerometer for the table measurement.
This script help you to coordinate the table signal with other signals you measured.
You may use all of your accelerometers on system chassis, so you need to do another measurement for the table. Afterward, you will need to coordinate other signals with table, this could be troublesome.
Before using this tool, please make sure you have the seperated excel file recording the table signal. Then, please follow the instructions: 
1. The script will first ask you to select the excel file recording the table signal.
2. The script will show you a plot of table signal.
3. The script will ask you to input two cut points, please choose a range between the two points based on the plot.
4. The script will ask you how many file do you need to process.
5. For each of your selected file, please type in the signal name which need to be coordinated.(usually it is the chassis base)
6. Check out the directory where your signal file is located and find the new output file.
